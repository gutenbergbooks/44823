<h2><span class="smlfont">MEMOIR</span><br />
<span class="xsmlfont">OF</span><br />
MAJOR SAMUEL S. FORMAN.</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">E</span>VERY addition to our stock of information touching
early western history and adventure, and of the pioneer
customs and habits of a hundred years ago, deserves
a kindly reception. The following narrative of a journey
down the Ohio and Mississippi, in 1789-90, was not reduced
to writing till 1849, after a lapse of sixty years;
but an unusually fine memory enabled Major Forman to
relate such incidents of his trip as left a lasting impression
upon him, alike with interest and general accuracy.
A sketch of the writer will give us a better insight into
his trustworthiness and character.</p>

<p>Major Forman, the third son of Samuel and Helena
Denise Forman, was born at Middletown Point, Monmouth
county, New Jersey, July 21, 1765. He was too young
to participate in the Revolutionary war, during the stirring
period of 1776 to 1780, in New Jersey; but his elder
brothers, Jonathan and Denise, were prominent and
active throughout the great struggle. Major Forman
has recorded some incidents of the war that occurred in
his region of New Jersey, and within his own knowledge,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>6]</a></span>
worthy of preservation as interesting scraps of Revolutionary
history. At one time, a cousin of his, Tunis
Forman, about seventeen years of age, met two Tory
robbers, and after one had fired at him and missed, he,
getting the advantage of them in the adjustment of his
gun, forced them to throw down their weapons, when he
marched them several miles before him, and lodged them
in jail at Freehold. For this brave act, young Forman
received a large reward.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_1_1" id="Footnote_1_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a>
This incident, occurring in May, 1780, is related in Barber and
Howe&rsquo;s <i>New Jersey Historical Collection</i>, 345-6. <a href="#FNanchor_1_1">Back</a></p>
</div>

<p>During the period while Major Henry Lee and his famous
Light Dragoons were serving in New Jersey, intelligence
came of the marauding operations of a band of
Tory robbers, located in the extensive pine woods toward
Barnegat, in Monmouth county, whose head-quarters were
at a secret cave in that region. Lee dispatched a select
party of fearless men, who approached the dangerous
region in a farmer&rsquo;s wagon, concealed under a covering
of straw. Fagans, the robber leader, with some followers,
stopped the wagon to plunder it, when the concealed
dragoons immediately put a ball through Fagans&rsquo;s head,
and with his fall his associates fled. Fagans&rsquo;s body was
conveyed to Barkalow&rsquo;s woods, the usual place of execution
for such culprits, and there exposed on a gibbet till
the flesh dropped from the bones.</p>

<p>Mr. Forman mentions that his father, Samuel Forman,
did not escape a visit from the Tories and British. At
one time, they made a descent upon the village of Middletown
Point. There was a mill at this place, which was
well known and much resorted to for a great distance;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>7]</a></span>
and some of these Tory invaders had been employed in
the erection of this mill, and were personally well known
to the citizens, and it would appear that their object was,
at least, to capture Samuel Forman, if not to kill him.
They plundered the houses of the settlement, destroying
what they could not carry off, boasting that they had
aided in building the mill, and now assisted in kindling
the fire in the bolting box to burn it down. They had
surprised the guard placed for the protection of the
place, killing several of their number, who had been their
schoolmates in former years. Samuel Forman eluded
their vigilance, but lost heavily by this invasion, for he
owned almost all of one side of Middletown Point, and
part of both sides of Main street. He never applied to
Congress for any remuneration for his losses. He died in
1792, in his seventy-eighth year. In this foray, the enemy
burned two store-houses of Mr. John H. Burrows, robbed
his house, and took him prisoner to New York. After
several months, he was exchanged, and returned home.</p>

<p>My brother, Denise Forman, entered the service when
he was about sixteen years old. He was in the battle of
Germantown&mdash;in which engagement eighteen of the Forman
connection took part&mdash;where the Americans were
badly used, on account of the British having some light
artillery in a large stone house. Our army had to retreat;
when that took place, Lieutenant Schenck, under
whom brother Denise served, took Denise&rsquo;s gun, and
told him to take fast hold of his coat, and cling to it during
the retreat. General David Forman conducted himself
so well, that General Washington tendered his aid in
securing a command in the Continental army; but General
Forman declined the offer, as he believed he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>8]</a></span>
could be more serviceable to remain with the militia in
Monmouth county, New Jersey, as they were continually
harassed there by the enemy from Staten Island and New
York.</p>

<p>After this, Denise Forman engaged under a Captain
Tyler, who had charge of a few gun-boats that coasted
along the Jersey shore, to annoy and oppose the enemy.
When the British fleet lay at anchor near Sandy Hook,
Captain Tyler went, in the night, and surprised a large
sloop at anchor among the men-of-war. Tyler&rsquo;s party
boarded the sloop, secured the sailors, weighed anchor,
and got her out from the fleet, and took her up Middletown
creek, all without any fighting. The whole enterprise
was conducted with so much judgment, that the
sailor prisoners dared not speak or give the least sign of
alarm. &ldquo;When we first touched the sloop,&rdquo; said Denise
Forman, &ldquo;I felt for a moment a little streaked, but it was
soon over, and then we worked fearlessly to get the
vessel under weigh, without alarming the fleet.&rdquo; These
gun-boats were all propelled by muffled oars, that dipped
in and out of the water so as to make no noise; nor did
any of the men speak above their breath. On the gunwale
of the boat, a strip of heavy canvas was nailed, the
inner edge having been left unfastened, under which were
concealed their swords, guns, and other implements for
use in a combat, and so placed that each man could, at
an instant&rsquo;s notice, lay his hand upon his own weapon.
Even in port, the men belonging to Tyler&rsquo;s party were
not allowed to talk or speak to other people, as a matter
of precaution; and the captain always spoke in an undertone,
and if a man laid down an oar, it was always done
as noiselessly as possible.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>9]</a></span>
At one time, fifteen hundred British and Tories landed
on Middletown shore, and marched from six to ten miles
back into the country. A beacon, placed on a conspicuous
hill, was fired for the purpose of giving an alarm;
and soon the militia of the country, understanding the
notice, gathered, and opposed the enemy. In Pleasant
Valley they checked their advance. Uncle John Schenck
and brother Denise so closely cornered a British or Tory
officer of this party in a barn-yard, that he jumped from
his horse, took to his heels and escaped, leaving his horse
behind him.</p>

<p>Major Burrows<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> happened to be at home at that time,
on a visit to his family. Some of the Americans dressed
themselves in British red coats, which had been captured.
The Rev. Mr. DuBois, who, like a good patriot, had
turned out on this occasion, with his fowling-piece,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>10]</a></span>
when Major Burrows rode near by, eked out in British
uniform; Mr. DuBois spoke to Captain Schenck, his
brother-in-law, &ldquo;Look, there is a good shot,&rdquo; and, suiting
the action to the word, took deliberate aim. Captain
Schenck, better understanding the situation, quickly
knocked up the clergyman&rsquo;s gun, with the explanation&mdash;&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
shoot; that&rsquo;s Major Burrows.&rdquo; Mr. DuBois
supposed he was aiming at a British officer, within point
blank shot, who was endeavoring to rejoin his fellows.</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_2_2" id="Footnote_2_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2_2"><span class="label">[2]</span></a>
Major John Burrows was first a captain in Colonel David Forman&rsquo;s
regiment. Forman had the nick-name of &ldquo;Black David,&rdquo;
to distinguish him from a relative of the same name, and he was
always a terror to the Tories; and Captain Burrows, from his efficiency
against these marauders, was called by those enemies of
the country, &ldquo;Black David&rsquo;s Devil.&rdquo; January 1, 1777, Captain
Burrows was made a captain in Spencer&rsquo;s regiment on Continental
establishment; and, January 22, 1779, he was promoted to the
rank of major, serving in Sullivan&rsquo;s campaign against the hostile
Six Nations, and remaining in the army till the close of the war.
Several years after, he went on a journey to the interior of
Georgia, in an unhealthy season, when he probably sickened and
died, for he was never heard of afterward.</p>

<p>Major Burrows left an interesting journal of Sullivan&rsquo;s campaign,
which appears in the splendid volume on that campaign
issued by the State of New York, in 1887. The original MS.
journal is preserved by his grand-daughter, Mrs. Elizabeth
Breese Stevens, of Sconondoa, Oneida county, New York. <a href="#FNanchor_2_2">Back</a></p>
</div>

<p>Denise Forman&rsquo;s next move was to enlist with Captain
Philip Freneau, the well-known poet, who sailed from
Philadelphia in a letter of marque, the <i>Aurora</i>, against
British commerce on the high seas. While not long out,
sailing toward the West Indies, Freneau and his adventurous
vessel were captured by their enemies, sent to
New York, and all incarcerated on board of the <i>Scorpion</i>,
one of the prison ships floating in New York harbor and
Wallabout Bay, its unhappy prisoners experiencing
almost untold horrors. Captain Freneau, at least, was
subsequently transferred to what he denominated &ldquo;the
loathesome <i>Hunter</i>.&rdquo; These prison ships attained an
unenviable reputation for maltreating and half-starving
their hapless and ill-fated victims, hundreds of whom
died in consequence of their inhuman treatment. This
sad experience became the subject of one of Freneau&rsquo;s
subsequent poems, emanating from the depths of his embittered
soul recollections. Brother Denise used to relate
to me, after his return home, that, when on the
prison ship, he had to shut his eyes whenever he ate the
sea-biscuit or drank the water assigned him, so full were
they of vermin! Freneau, in his poem, thus alludes to
the fare with which the poor prisoners were treated:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>11]</a></span>
<span class="i0">&ldquo;See, captain, see! what rotten bones we pick.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What kills the healthy can not cure the sick.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not dogs on <em>such</em> by Christian men are fed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And see, good master, see that lousy bread!&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Your meat or bread,&rdquo; this man of flint replied,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Is not my care to manage or provide;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But this, damn&rsquo;d rebel dogs, I&rsquo;d have you know,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That better than you merit we bestow.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Out of my sight!&rdquo; No more he deigned to say,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But whisk&rsquo;d about, and, frowning, strode away.<br /></span>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>When the survivors were exchanged, after their long
imprisonment, they were so weak and emaciated that
they could scarcely walk&mdash;perfect living skeletons; and
my brother, after his return home, was confined to his
bed, and for several days nearly all hope of his recovery
was abandoned; but he at length providentially
recovered. Denise Forman received a captain&rsquo;s commission
when a war was threatened with France, in 1798,
and when the army was disbanded, he settled on a farm
in Freehold, where he spent the remainder of his days.</p>

<p>About 1790, Captain Freneau married my sister
Eleanor. He was a prominent Anti-Federalist in his
day, and edited various Democratic papers at different
places, and was for a time translating clerk in the State
Department. While he was able to translate the French
documents, he found it cost him more than he received
to get those in other foreign languages properly translated,
and after a while he resigned. He had in early
life been a college-mate with James Madison, at Princeton,
and has been aptly called the &ldquo;patriot poet&rdquo; of the
Revolution, his effusions having been useful to the cause
of the country during its great struggle for independence.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>12]</a></span>
He lost his life in a violent snow-storm, in December, 1832,
in his eighty-first year, near Monmouth, New Jersey.</p>

<p>While attending grammar-school, the latter part of the
Revolutionary war, at Freehold, young Forman records:
The hottest part of the battle of Monmouth was about
this spot, where my brother-in-law, Major Burrows, lived
after he left the army, and with whom I and some
fellow-students boarded. Our path to the school-house
crossed a grave where a remarkably tall British officer
was buried. We opened the grave; a few pieces only of
blanket, which encompassed the corpse, remained. One
school-mate, Barnes Smock, was a very tall person, but
the thigh bones of this unfortunate officer far outmeasured
his. I believe this was the only engagement
when the two opposing armies had recourse to the
bayonet,<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> and this was the place of that charge. The
battle took place on the Sabbath. A British cannon ball
went through Rev. Dr. Woodhull&rsquo;s church. Dr. Woodhull
was now one of my teachers. The two armies lay
upon their arms all night after the battle. General
Washington and General La Fayette slept in their cloaks
under an apple-tree in Mr. Henry Perrine&rsquo;s orchard. It
was Washington&rsquo;s intention to have renewed the battle
the next day, but the British, in the course of the night,
stole a march as fast as they could for their fleet at
Sandy Hook.</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_3_3" id="Footnote_3_3"></a><a href="#FNanchor_3_3"><span class="label">[3]</span></a>
This is an error. Bayonet charges were resorted to by Morgan
at the Cowpens, and in other engagements. <a href="#FNanchor_3_3">Back</a></p>
</div>

<p>In the spring of 1783, when peace was dawning, many
of the old citizens of New York City, who had been exiled
from their homes for some seven years, began to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>13]</a></span>
return to their abandoned domiciles, even before the British
evacuation. Among them was Major Benjamin Ledyard,
who had married my oldest sister. In September of that
year, at the instance of my sister Ledyard, I went to
New York as a member of her family. Every day I saw
the British soldiers. Indeed, a young lieutenant boarded
a short time in our family, as many families received the
British officers as an act of courtesy.</p>

<p>Even before the British evacuation, the American officers
were permitted to cross over into the city, and frequently
came, visiting the coffee-houses and other places
of public resort. Here they would meet British officers,
and some of them evinced a strong inclination to make
disturbance with their late competitors, throwing out
hints or casting reflections well calculated to provoke
personal combats. There was a Captain Stakes, of the
American Light Dragoons, a fine, large, well-built man,
who had no fear about him. It was said, when he entered
the coffee-house, that the British officers exercised
a wholesome caution how they treated him, after some of
them had made a feint in testing his powers. But it all
happily passed over without harm.</p>

<p>It was finally agreed between General Washington and
Sir Guy Carleton that New York should be evacuated
November 25th. In the morning of that day, the British
army paraded in the Bowery. The Americans also
paraded, and marched down till they came very close to
each other, so that the officers of both armies held
friendly parleys. The streets were crowded with people
on an occasion so interesting. I hurried by the redcoats
till I reached the Americans, where I knew I would
be safe. So I sauntered about among the officer.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>14]</a></span>
Presently, an American officer seized me by the hand, when,
I looking up at him, he said, encouragingly: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be
afraid, Sammy. I know your brother Jonathan. He is
an officer in the same line with me, and my name is
Cumming.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> He continued to hold me by the hand till
orders were given to advance. He advised me to keep
on the sidewalk, as I might get run over in the street.</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_4_4" id="Footnote_4_4"></a><a href="#FNanchor_4_4"><span class="label">[4]</span></a>
This was John N. Cumming, who rose from a lieutenant to
be lieutenant-colonel, commanding the Third New Jersey Regiment,
serving the entire war. <a href="#FNanchor_4_4">Back</a></p>
</div>

<p>The British steadily marched in the direction of their
vessels, while the Americans advanced down Queen (since
Pearl) street; the British embarking on board their fleet
on East river, I believe, near Whitehall, and the Americans
headed directly to Fort George, on the point where
the Battery now is. Stockades were around the fort,
and the large gate was opened. When the British evacuated
the fort, they unreefed the halyards of the tall flag-staff,
greased the pole, so that it was some time before
the American flag was hoisted. At length, a young soldier<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
succeeded in climbing the pole, properly arranged
the halyards, when up ran the striped and star-spangled
banner, amid the deafening shouts of the multitude, that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>15]</a></span>
seemed to shake the city. It is easier to imagine than
to describe the rejoicing, and the brilliancy of the fireworks
that evening.</p>

The editor, while at Saratoga Springs, in 1838, took occasion
to visit the venerable Anthony Glean, who resided in the town
of Saratoga, and who was reputed to be the person who climbed
the greased flag-staff at the evacuation of New York, and who
himself claimed to have performed that feat. He was then a
well-to-do farmer, enjoying a pension for his revolutionary services,
and lived two or three years later, till he had reached the
age of well-nigh ninety. The newspapers of that period often
referred to him as the hero of the flag-staff exploit, and no one
called it in question. <a href="#FNanchor_5_5">Back</a></p>
</div>

<p>After the evacuation, Mr. Forman witnessed the affectionate
and affecting parting of Washington and his
officers, when he entered a barge at Whitehall wharf,
manned by sea captains in white frocks, who rowed him
to the Jersey shore, to take the stage for Philadelphia,
on his way to Congress. Mr. Forman also saw General
Washington while presiding over the convention of 1787,
to form a Constitution for the new Republic. The general
was attired in citizen&rsquo;s dress&mdash;blue coat, cocked hat,
hair in queue, crossed and powdered. He walked alone
to the State House, the place of meeting, and seemed
pressed down in thought. A few moments before General
Washington took his seat on the rostrum, the venerable
Dr. Franklin, one of the Pennsylvania delegates,
was brought in by a posse of men in his sedan, and
helped into the hall, he being severely afflicted with palsy
or paralysis at the time. On the adoption of the Constitution,
a great celebration was held in New York to commemorate
the event, which Mr. Forman also witnessed.
A large procession was formed, composed of men of all
avocations in life, and each represented by some insignia of
his own trade or profession, marching through the streets
with banners, flags, and stirring music. A full-rigged
vessel, called &ldquo;The Federal Ship Hamilton,&rdquo; was drawn
in the procession, and located in Bowling Green, where
it remained until it fell to pieces by age.</p>

<p>After spending some years as a clerk in mercantile
establishments in New York City, and once going as
supercargo to dispose of a load of flour to Charleston, he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>16]</a></span>
engaged in merchandising at Middletown Point, New
Jersey. Mr. Forman subsequently made the journey
down the Ohio and Mississippi, in 1789-&rsquo;90, as given in
considerable detail in the narrative which follows.
While spending the winter of 1792-&rsquo;93 in Philadelphia,
he witnessed the inauguration of Washington as President,
at the beginning of his second term of office, and
was within six feet of him when he took the oath of
office. &ldquo;I cast my eyes over the vast crowd,&rdquo; says
Major Forman, &ldquo;and every eye seemed riveted on the
great chief. On Washington&rsquo;s right sat Chief-Justice
Cushing, and on his left Senator Langdon, of New
Hampshire. After sitting a little while in profound
silence, the senator arose, and asked the President if
he was ready to take the oath of office. General Washington
rose up, having a paper in his left hand, when he
made a very short address. Then Judge Cushing stood
up, with a large open Bible before him, facing the
President, who laid his hand upon the sacred volume, and
very deliberately and distinctly repeated the oath of
office as pronounced by the chief-justice. When Washington
repeated his own name, as he did at the conclusion
of the ceremony, it made my blood run cold.
The whole proceedings were performed with great
solemnity. General Washington was dressed in deep
mourning, for, it was said, a favorite nephew who had
lived at Mount Vernon during the Revolutionary war.
He wore his mourning sword. Mrs. Washington was
about the middling stature, and pretty fleshy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Forman now entered into the employ of the Holland
Land Company, through their agents, Theophilus Cazenove
and John Lincklaen, to found a settlement in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>17]</a></span>
back part of the State of New York, where that company
had purchased a large body of land. He accordingly
headed a party, in conjunction with Mr.
Lincklaen, for this purpose, conveying a load of merchandise
to the point of operations, passing in batteaus
up the Mohawk to old Fort Schuyler, now Utica, beyond
which it was necessary to open up a road for the
teams and loads of goods; lodging in the woods when
necessary, living on raw pork and bread, which was better
than the bill of fare at the well-known tavern in that
region, kept by John Dennie, the half Indian&mdash;&ldquo;no
bread, no meat;&rdquo; and one of Dennie&rsquo;s descendants indignantly
resented being referred to as an Indian&mdash;&ldquo;Me
no Indian; only Frenchman and squaw!&rdquo; At length,
May 8, 1793, the party arrived on the beautiful body of
water, since known as Cazenovia Lake, and founded the
village of Cazenovia, where Mr. Forman engaged in
felling trees, and erecting the necessary houses in which
to live and do business, and in this rising settlement he
engaged in merchandising for several years. He held
many public positions of honor and trust; was county
clerk, secretary for over thirty years of a turnpike
company; served as major in a regiment of militia early
organized at Cazenovia.</p>

<p>The latter years of his life he spent in Syracuse,
where he was greatly respected for his worth, his fine
conversational powers, his social and generous feelings.
He lived to the great age of over ninety-seven years,
dying August 16, 1862. His closing years were embittered
over the distracted condition of his country,
embroiled in fratricidal war, and his prayer was that the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>18]</a></span>
proud flag which he witnessed when it was placed over
the ramparts of Fort George, November 25, 1783,
might again wave its ample folds over a firmly united
American Confederacy. His patriotic prayer was answered,
though he did not himself live to witness it.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">G</span>ENERAL DAVID FORMAN,<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> of New Jersey,
entered into a negotiation with the Spanish minister,
Don Diego de Gardoque, for his brother, Ezekiel
Forman, of Philadelphia, to emigrate with his family and
sixty odd colored people, and settle in the Natchez
country, then under Spanish authority.</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_6_6" id="Footnote_6_6"></a><a href="#FNanchor_6_6"><span class="label">[6]</span></a>
General Forman was born near Englishtown, Monmouth
Co., New Jersey. He was, during the Revolutionary war, a terror
to the tories of his region, and as brigadier-general commanded
the Jersey troops at the battle of Germantown. No less
than eighteen of the Forman connection were in his brigade in
this engagement. He was subsequently a county judge, and
member of the council of state. He died about 1812. <a href="#FNanchor_6_6">Back</a></p>
</div>

<p>I agreed with General Forman to accompany the emigrating
party; and, about the last of November, 1789,
having closed up my little business at Middletown Point,
New Jersey, I set out from the general&rsquo;s residence, in
Freehold, with Captain Benajah Osmun, an old continental
captain, who was at that time the faithful overseer
of the general&rsquo;s blacks. There were sixty men, women,
and children, and they were the best set of blacks I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>20]</a></span>
ever saw together. I knew the most of them, and all
were well-behaved, except two rather ill-tempered fellows.
General Forman purchased some more, who had intermarried
with his own, so as not to separate families.
They were all well fed and well clothed.</p>

<p>We had, I believe, four teams of four horses each,
and one two-horse wagon, all covered with tow-cloth,
while Captain Osmun and I rode on horseback. After
the distressing scene of taking leave&mdash;for the general&rsquo;s
family and blacks were almost all in tears&mdash;we sat out upon
our long journey. The first night we camped on the plains
near Cranberry, having accomplished only about twelve
or fifteen miles. The captain and I had a bed put under
one of the wagons; the sides of the wagon had
tenter-hooks, and curtains made to hook up to them,
with loops to peg the bottom to the ground. The colored
people mostly slept in their wagons. In the night
a heavy rain fell, when the captain and I fared badly.
The ground was level, and the water, unable to run off,
gave us a good soaking. I had on a new pair of handsome
buckskin small clothes; the rain spoiled their
beauty, and the wetting and subsequent shrinkage rendered
them very uncomfortable to wear.</p>

<p>The next morning we commenced our journey as early
as possible. We drove to Princeton, where we tarried
awhile, and all were made comfortable. We crossed the
Delaware five miles above Trenton. On arriving at
Lancaster, in Pennsylvania, the authorities stopped us, as
we somewhat expected they would do. General Forman
had furnished me with all the necessary papers relating to
the transportation of slaves through New Jersey and Pennsylvania.
While Judge Hubley was examining the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>21]</a></span>
papers, the servant women informed me that the females
of the city came out of their houses and inquired of
them whether they could spin, knit, sew, and do housework,
and whether they were willing to go to the South;
so, if the authorities stopped us, they could all soon
have new homes. But our colored women laughed at the
Lancaster ladies, who seemed mortified when they
learned that we could not be detained.</p>

<p>In Westmoreland county we had a little trouble with
a drunken justice of the peace and some free blacks.
These free blacks, as we learned from a faithful old colored
woman, furnished the two ill-tempered blacks of our
party with old swords and pistols, but nothing serious
grew out of it.</p>

<p>The weather began to grow very cold, the roads bad,
and traveling tedious. We encamped one night in the
woods, kindled a fire, and turned the tails of the wagons
all inward, thus forming a circle around the fire.
Another night we came to a vacant cabin without a
floor; we made a large fire, and all who chose took their
bedding and slept in the cabin, some remaining in the
wagons. The captain and I had our beds spread before
the fire.</p>

<p>One Saturday evening, we were apprehensive of being
obliged to encamp again in the woods. I went ahead,
hoping to find night quarters. I rode up to a log
house and went in; it was growing dark, and I began to
ask the landlord to accommodate us for the night, addressing
myself to a tall, lean man. Before I got through
with my inquiry, he caught me up in his arms, as if I
were merely a small child, and exclaimed: &ldquo;Mighty
souls! if this is not little Sammy Forman,&rdquo; and,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>22]</a></span>
hugging and kissing me, added, &ldquo;Why, don&rsquo;t you remember
Charley Morgan? Yes, you can have any thing I
have, and we will do the best we can for you.&rdquo; This was
somewhere in the Alleghany mountains, and here we remained
till Monday, buying wheat, and sending it to
mill, and converting a fat steer into meat, so that we
were well provided for, for awhile. This Charley Morgan
entered the regular service as a corporal in my
brother Jonathan&rsquo;s company, when he was a captain,
and raised his company in the vicinity of Middletown
Point, New Jersey. He could ape the simpleton very
well, and was sent as a spy into the British army, and
returned safe with the desired information. I was surprised
to meet him in this far-off mountain region.</p>

<p>Somewhere about Fort Littleton or Fort Loudon, our
funds ran out. When we left General Forman, he told
me that Uncle Ezekiel Forman would leave Philadelphia
with his family, and overtake us in time to supply our
wants. But he did not start as soon as he expected,
and on his way in the mountains the top of his carriage
got broken by a leaning tree, which somewhat detained
him, so that we arrived at Pittsburg two or three days
before him.</p>

<p>One morning, while in the neighborhood of Fort Littleton
or Fort Loudon, I offered to sell my horse to the landlord
where we took breakfast; he kept a store as well
as a tavern, and was wealthy. The price of the horse
I put very low, when the landlord asked why I offered
him so cheap. I informed him that I was out of funds,
and had expected that Ezekiel Forman, who owned the colored
people, would have overtaken us before our means
became exhausted. He replied: &ldquo;I know your uncle,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>23]</a></span>
and I will lend you as much money as you need, and take
your order on him, as he will stop here on his way.
Now, step with me to the store.&rdquo; Pointing to the large
piles of silver dollars on the counter in the store, he
said: &ldquo;Step up and help yourself to as much as you
want, and give me your order.&rdquo; This was an unexpected
favor. When uncle arrived, he satisfied the order.</p>

<p>It had taken us near three weeks to journey from
Monmouth to Pittsburg. After our arrival at this place,
our first business was to find situations for our numerous
family, while awaiting the rise of the Ohio, and to lay in
provisions for our long river voyage. Colonel Turnbull,
late of Philadelphia, and an acquaintance of uncle, politely
offered him the use of a vacant house and store-room,
exactly such apartments as were wanted. The
colored people were all comfortably housed also.</p>

<p>The horses and wagons were sold at a great sacrifice&mdash;uncle
retaining only his handsome coach horses and carriage,
which he took to Natchez on a tobacco boat, which
Captain Osmun commanded, and on board of which the
colored field hands were conveyed. These boats were
flat-bottomed, and boarded over the top, and appeared
like floating houses. Uncle&rsquo;s boat was a seventy feet
keel-boat, decked over, with a cabin for lodging purposes,
but too low to stand up erect. The beds and bedding
lay on the floor, and the insides lined with plank to prevent
the Indians from penetrating through with their
balls, should they attack us. We had a large quantity
of dry goods, and a few were opened and bartered in
payment for boats and provisions.</p>

<p>On board of the keel-boat, uncle and family found
comfortable quarters. Mr. and Mrs. Forman, Augusta,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>24]</a></span>
Margaret, and Frances, aged about nine, eleven, and
thirteen, and David Forman and Miss Betsey Church,
the latter housekeeper and companion for Aunt Forman,
an excellent woman, who had lived in the family
several years, and occasionally took the head of the
table. I and five or six others, two mechanics, and
about eight or ten house servants, were also occupants of
this boat.</p>

<p>The family received much polite attention while in
Pittsburg. By the time we got prepared for our departure,
the Ohio river rose. We tarried there about a
month. Both boats were armed with rifles, pistols, etc.
It being in Indian war time, all boats descending that
long river, of about eleven hundred miles, were liable to
be attacked every hour by a merciless foe, oftentimes
led on by renegade whites.</p>

<p>Uncle fixed on a certain Sabbath, as was the custom in
those days, to embark on ship-board. On that day, the
polite and hospitable Colonel Turnbull, then a widower,
gave uncle an elegant dinner, and invited several gentlemen
to grace the occasion with their presence. After
dinner, which was not prolonged, we embarked on board
our little squadron. Colonel Wm. Wyckoff, and his
brother-in-law, Kenneth Scudder, of Monmouth county,
New Jersey, accompanied us on our voyage. The colonel
had been, seven years previous to this, an Indian trader,
and was now on his way to Nashville, Tennessee.</p>

<p>Uncle Forman&rsquo;s keel-boat, Captain Osmun&rsquo;s flat-boat,
and Colonel Wyckoff&rsquo;s small keel-boat constituted our
little fleet. The day of our departure was remarkably
pleasant. Our number altogether must have reached very
nearly a hundred. The dinner party accompanied us to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>25]</a></span>
our boats, and the wharf was covered with citizens. The
river was very high, and the current rapid. It was on
the Monongahela where we embarked.</p>

<p>Our keel-boat took the lead. These boats are guided
by oars, seldom used, except the steering oar, or when
passing islands, as the current goes about six or seven
miles an hour. As the waters were now high, the current
was perhaps eight or nine miles an hour. Before
day-break next morning we made a narrow escape from
destruction, from our ignorance of river navigation. We
had an anchor and cable attached to our keel-boat. The
cable was made fast to small posts over the forecastle,
where were fenders all around the little deck. When it
began to grow dark, the anchor was thrown over, in
hopes of holding us fast till morning, while the other
boats were to tie up to trees along the river bank.</p>

<p>As soon as the anchor fastened itself in the river bottom,
the boat gave a little lurch or side motion, when the
cable tore away all the frame-work around the deck,
causing a great alarm. Several little black children
were on deck at the time, and as it had now become quite
dark, it could not be ascertained, in the excitement of the
moment, whether any of them had been thrown into the
water. Fortunately none were missing. During our
confusion, Captain Osmun&rsquo;s boat passed ours, a few minutes
after the accident, and we soon passed him, he hailing
us, saying that he was entangled in the top of a large
tree, which had caved into the river, and requested the
small row-boat to assist him. Uncle Forman immediately
dispatched the two mechanics, with the small boat,
to his assistance. Osmun got clear of the tree without
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>26]</a></span>
injury, and the two mechanics rowed hard, almost all
night, before they overtook him. Mrs. Forman and
daughters braved out our trying situation very firmly.</p>

<p>After we lost our anchor, Uncle Forman took a chair,
and seated himself on the forecastle, like a pilot, and I
took the helm. He kept watch, notifying me when to
change the direction of the boat. When he cried out to
me, &ldquo;port your helm,&rdquo; it was to keep straight in the
middle of the stream; if to bear to the left, he would cry
out, &ldquo;starboard;&rdquo; if to the right, &ldquo;larboard.&rdquo; I was not
able to manage the helm alone, and had a man with me
to assist in pulling as directed. Uncle Forman and I
were the only ones of our party who understood sailor&rsquo;s
terms. Ours was a perilous situation till we landed at
Wheeling; it was the most distressing night I ever experienced.</p>

<p>The next morning, all our boats landed at Wheeling,
Virginia, rated at ninety-six miles from Pittsburg. Here
we obtained a large steering oar for the keel-boat, as the
strong current kept the rudder from acting, without the
application of great strength. Having adjusted matters,
we set out again. We seldom ventured to land on our
journey, for fear of lurking Indians.</p>

<p>One day, we discovered large flocks of wild turkeys
flying about in the woods on shore. The blacksmith, who
was a fine, active young man, asked Uncle Forman to
set him on shore, and give him a chance to kill some of
them. The little boat was manned, and taking his rifle
and a favorite dog, he soon landed. But he had not been
long on shore, before he ran back to the river&rsquo;s bank,
and made signs for the boat to come and take him on
board. When safely among his friends, he said that he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>27]</a></span>
came to a large fire, and, from appearances, he supposed
a party of Indians was not far off. He, however, lost
his fine dog, for he dared not call him.</p>

<p>We landed and stopped at Marietta, at the mouth of
the Muskingum, where was a United States garrison.
Some of the officers were acquainted with the family.
It was a very agreeable occurrence to meet with old acquaintances
in such a dreary place. The young ladies
were good singers, and entertained the officers awhile
with their vocal music. This night, we felt secure in
sleeping away the fatigues of the journey. Governor
St. Clair had his family here. There were a few other
families, also; but all protected by the troops. I believe
there was no other settlement<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> until we arrived at Fort
Washington, now Cincinnati, some three hundred miles
below Marietta.</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_7_7" id="Footnote_7_7"></a><a href="#FNanchor_7_7"><span class="label">[7]</span></a>
Mr. Forman forgot to mention Limestone, now Maysville,
Kentucky, some sixty miles above Cincinnati, an older settlement
by some four years than Marietta or Cincinnati. Perhaps
it was passed in the night, and unobserved. And Columbia, too,
at the mouth of the Little Miami, about six miles above Cincinnati,
and a few months its senior in settlement. <a href="#FNanchor_7_7">Back</a></p>
</div>

<p>A few hundred yards above Fort Washington, we
landed our boats, when Uncle Forman, Colonel Wyckoff,
and I went on shore, and walked up to head-quarters, to
pay our respects to General Harmar, the commander of
our troops in the North-western Territory. The general
received us with much politeness. As we were about
taking leave of him, he kindly invited us to remain and
take a family dinner with him, observing to Uncle, that we
should have the opportunity of testing the deliciousness of
what he may never have partaken before&mdash;the haunch of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>28]</a></span>
a fine buffalo. It being near dining hour, the invitation
was, of course, accepted. As the general and lady were
acquainted with Uncle and Aunt Forman in Philadelphia,
they very politely extended their kindness by asking that
Uncle, Aunt, and their family, together with Colonel
Wyckoff and Brother-in-law Scudder and Captain Osmun,
would spend the next day with them, which was accepted
with great pleasure. General Harmar directed where to
move our little fleet, so that all should be safe under
military guard. We then returned to our boats, and
conveyed them down to the appointed place.</p>

<p>The next morning, after breakfast, and after attending
to our toilets, we repaired to General Harmar&rsquo;s head-quarters,
where we were all received most cordially.
Our company consisted of Mr. and Mrs. Forman, their
three daughters, and Master David Forman, Miss Church,
Captain Osmun, S.&nbsp;S. Forman, Colonel Wyckoff, and Mr.
Scudder&mdash;eleven in all.</p>

<p>Mrs. Forman and Mrs. Harmar resembled each other
as much as though they were sisters. The general invited
some of his officers to share his hospitalities, also,
and we had a most sumptuous dinner and tea. Before it
was quite dark, we took leave of our hospitable friends.
I had the honor of a seat at the table next to the general.
While at dinner, the officer of the day called on
General Harmar for the countersign, so as to place out
the sentinels. Captain Kirby,<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> of the army, who dined
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>29]</a></span>
with us, was directed by the general to accompany us on
our return to our boats. Just before we came to the
sentinel, Captain Kirby asked us to halt, until he could
advance and give the countersign, which is done with
much prudence. I sauntered along, and happened to
hear the challenge by the guard, and the reply of the
captain. The countersign was, I believe, &ldquo;Forman.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_8_8" id="Footnote_8_8"></a><a href="#FNanchor_8_8"><span class="label">[8]</span></a>
Neither the <i>Dictionary of the Army</i>, the <i>MS. Harmar Papers</i>,
nor the <i>Journal of Major Denny</i>, who was then an aide to General
Harmar, make any mention of a Captain Kirby. It is probable,
that William Kersey was the officer referred to. He served in
New Jersey during the Revolution, rising from a private to a
captaincy by brevet at the close of the war. At this period,
early in 1790, he was a lieutenant. Probably, by courtesy of his
rank and title in the Revolution, he was called captain. He attained
that rank the following year; major, in 1794; and died,
March 21, 1800. <a href="#FNanchor_8_8">Back</a></p>
</div>

<p>In the morning, Captain Osmun said to me, that,
after paying our respects to General Harmar, he wanted
me to accompany him to the quarters of the other officers,
as he probably knew all of them; that they were
old continental officers retained in service, and he added:
&ldquo;They all know your brother, Colonel Jonathan Forman,<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>
of the Revolution, and will be glad to see you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>30]</a></span>
on his account.&rdquo; We, accordingly, after our interview
with General Harmar, went to their quarters. They
recollected Captain Osmun, and he introduced me, when
they welcomed me most cordially, and made many inquiries
after my brother.</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_9_9" id="Footnote_9_9"></a><a href="#FNanchor_9_9"><span class="label">[9]</span></a>
Jonathan Forman was born October 16, 1755; was educated
at Princeton College, where he was a fellow-student with James
Madison, and entering the army in 1776 served as captain for
five years, during which he participated in Sullivan&rsquo;s campaign
against the hostile Six Nations; and, promoted to the rank of
major in 1781, he served under La Fayette in Virginia; and early
in 1783 he was made a lieutenant-colonel, and continued in the
army till the end of the war. He headed a regiment against
the whisky insurgents of West Pennsylvania in 1794, and two
years later he removed to Cazenovia, N.&nbsp;Y., where he filled the
position of supervisor, member of the legislature and brigadier-general
in the militia. He married Miss Mary Ledyard, of New
London, Conn., who &ldquo;went over her shoe tops in blood,&rdquo; in the
barn where the wounded lay, the morning after Arnold&rsquo;s descent
on New London and Fort Griswold, on Groton Heights, where
her uncle, Colonel William Ledyard, was killed in cold blood
after his surrender. General Forman died at Cazenovia, May
25, 1809, in his sixty-fourth year, and his remains repose in the
beautiful cemetery at that place. <a href="#FNanchor_9_9">Back</a></p>

<p>I think it was in the autumn of 1790 that General
Harmar was defeated by the Indians, and most of these
brave officers were killed. At that period officers wore
three-cornered hats, and by that means nearly all of
them were singled out and killed, as they could be so
easily distinguished from others.</p>

<p>Some distance above Fort Washington, the Scioto
river empties into the Ohio. Near this river was a
cave, which the whites had not discovered till after
Harmar&rsquo;s defeat. Here the Indians would sally out
against boats ascending the Ohio. A canoe passed us
the day before we passed the Scioto, which had been
fired into at that point, one man having been shot
through the shoulder, another through the calf of the
leg, while the third escaped unhurt. When these poor
fellows arrived at Fort Washington, they waited for us.
After our arrival, understanding that we were going to
tarry a day, they set off. Harmar&rsquo;s defeat caused
a French settlement near the Scioto to be broken up;<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>
some of them were killed by the Indians.</p>

The Gallipolis settlement was much annoyed by the Indians;
some of the poor French settlers were killed, others
abandoned the place, but the settlement was maintained, despite
all their trials and sufferings. <a href="#FNanchor_10_10">Back</a></p>

I must mention an anecdote about my friend, Captain
Osmun. At the battle of Long Island, and capture of
New York by the British, many American prisoners
were taken, Captain Osmun among them. He pretended
to be a little acquainted with the profession of physic,
but he never studied it, and could bleed, draw teeth,
etc. A German officer had a very sick child, the case
baffling the skill of all the English and German physicians,
and the child&rsquo;s recovery was given up as hopeless.
At last it was suggested to call in the rebel doctor.
So Osmun was sent for. He suppressed as well
as he could his half-comical, half-quizzical expression,
and assumed a serious look; felt of the child&rsquo;s pulse,
and merely said he would prepare some pills and call
again. He accordingly did so, giving the necessary directions,
and promised to call at the proper time to
learn the effect. When he called the third time the
child had grown much better, and finally recovered.
He said that all he did for the little sufferer was to
administer a little powder-post, mixed up with rye-bread,
made into little pills. He said he knew they
could do no harm, if they did no good, and regarded
himself as only an instrument in the hands of the Almighty
in saving the child&rsquo;s life. The father of the
child gave him almost a handful of guineas. Prior to
this occurrence he had, while a prisoner, suffered for the
necessaries of life, but thenceforward he was able to procure
needful comforts till his exchange.</p>

<p>The next morning, after our entertainment by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>32]</a></span>
General Harmar and lady, we renewed our journey, floating
rapidly down the Belle Riviere. Nothing of moment
occurred till our arrival at Louisville, at the Falls of
the Ohio. The weather now grew so severely cold, in
the latter part of January, 1790, that the river became
blocked with ice. Here we laid up, disembarked, and
took a house in the village, the front part of which was
furnished for a store, which exactly suited us, and
which was gratuitously offered to Uncle Forman by a
Mr. Rhea, of Tennessee. We were remarkably fortunate
in this respect, both here and at Pittsburg.</p>

<p>Here I opened a store from our stock of goods, and
took tobacco in payment, which was the object in bringing
the merchandise. Louisville then contained about
sixty dwelling-houses. Directly opposite was Fort Jefferson,<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>
which was, I believe, only a captain&rsquo;s command.
At the Great Miami was Judge Symmes&rsquo;s settlement,<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>33]</a></span>
which dragged heavily along at that time, having been
allowed only a sergeant&rsquo;s command for its protection.</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_11_11" id="Footnote_11_11"></a><a href="#FNanchor_11_11"><span class="label">[11]</span></a>
This is evidently an error of memory; it was known as Fort
Steuben, located where Jeffersonville now is. <a href="#FNanchor_11_11">Back</a></p>
</div>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_12_12" id="Footnote_12_12"></a><a href="#FNanchor_12_12"><span class="label">[12]</span></a>
Trivial circumstances sometimes change the fate of nations,
and so it would seem they do of cities also. North Bend might
have become the great commercial metropolis of the Miami
country, instead of Cincinnati, but for an affair of the heart, if
we may credit the tradition preserved by Judge Burnet in his
<i>Notes on the North-western Territory</i>. Ensign Francis Luce had
been detailed, with a small force, for the protection of the North
Bend settlement, and to locate a suitable site for a block-house.
While the ensign was keenly but very leisurely on the lookout
for a proper location, he made a discovery far more interesting
to him&mdash;a beautiful black-eyed lady, the wife of one of the settlers.
Luce became infatuated with her charms, and her husband,
seeing the danger to which he was exposed if he remained
where he was, resolved at once to remove to Cincinnati.</p>

<p>The gallant ensign was equal to the unexpected emergency,
for he now began to discover what he had not discovered before,
that North Bend was not, after all, so desirable a locality
for the contemplated block-house as Cincinnati, and forthwith
apprised Judge Symmes of these views, who strenuously opposed
the movement. But the judge&rsquo;s arguments were not so
effective as the sparkling eyes of the fair dulcinea then at Cincinnati.
And so Luce and his military force were transplanted
in double-quick time to Cincinnati; and where the troops were
the settlers congregated for their protection and safety. And so,
the Queen City of the West followed the fortunes of this unnamed
forest queen, who so completely beguiled the impressible
ensign.</p>

<p>In this case there was no ten years&rsquo; war, as in the case of the
beautiful Spartan dame, which ended in the destruction of Troy;
but, by Luce&rsquo;s infatuation and removal, North Bend was as much
fated as though the combined Indians of the North-west had
blotted it out of existence. Soon after this portentious removal,
Luce, on May 1, 1790, resigned from the army&mdash;whether on account
of his fair charmer, history fails to tell us. This romantic
story has been doubted by some, but Judge Burnet was an early
settler of Cincinnati, and had good opportunities to get at the
facts; and when I met the judge, fully forty years ago, he
seemed not the man likely to indulge in romancing. That General
Harmar, in forwarding Luce&rsquo;s resignation to the War Office,
seemed particularly anxious that it should be accepted, would
seem to imply that, for this intrigue, or some other cause, the
general was desirous of ridding the service of him. <a href="#FNanchor_12_12">Back</a></p>
</div>

<p>Besides Symmes&rsquo;, there was no other settlement between
Cincinnati and Louisville, except that of a French gentleman
named Lacassangue, a few miles above Louisville,
who began a vineyard on the Indian side of the river;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>34]</a></span>
and one day Indians visited it, killing his people, and
destroying his vines.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> Mr. Lacassangue was a polite,
hospitable man, and gave elegant dinners.</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_13_13" id="Footnote_13_13"></a><a href="#FNanchor_13_13"><span class="label">[13]</span></a>
Michael Lacassangue, a Frenchman of education, settled in
Louisville as a merchant prior to March, 1789, when General
Harmar addressed him as a merchant there. He located a
station on the northern shore of the Ohio, three miles above
Fort Steuben, now Jeffersonville, where he had purchased land
in the Clark grant. In a MS. letter of Captain Joseph Ashton,
commanding at Fort Steuben, addressed to General Harmar,
April 3, 1790, these facts are given relative to the attack on
Lacassangue&rsquo;s station. That on the preceding March 29th, the
Indians made their attack, killing one man. There were only
two men, their wives, and fourteen children in the station.
Word was immediately conveyed to Captain Ashton of their
situation, who detached a sergeant and fourteen men to their relief,
and who arrived there, Captain Ashton states, in sixteen
minutes after receiving intelligence of the attack. The Indians,
three in number, had decamped, and were pursued several miles
until their trail was lost on a dry ridge. The families were removed
to Fort Steuben, and thus the station was, for a time,
broken up.</p>

<p>Mr. Lacassangue must have been quite a prominent trader at
Louisville in his day. About the first of June, 1790, Colonel
Vigo, an enterprising trader of the Illinois country, consigned
to him 4,000 pounds of lead, brought by Major Doughty from
Kaskaskia. Mr. Lacassangue made efforts, in after years, to
give character to his new town of Cassania&mdash;a name evidently
coined out of his own&mdash;hoping from its more healthful situation,
and better location for the landing of vessels destined to pass
the Falls, to supplant Louisville. The little place, General Collot
says, had in 1796, when he saw it, &ldquo;only two or three houses,
and a store.&rdquo; The ambitious effort was a vain one, and Cassania
soon became lost to the geographical nomenclature of the
country. Mr. Lacassangue died in 1797. <a href="#FNanchor_13_13">Back</a></p>
</div>

<p>A nephew of Mrs. Washington of the name of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>35]</a></span>
Dandridge lived with Mr. Lacassangue. When I returned to
Philadelphia, I there met him again; he resided at General
Washington&rsquo;s. While the Dandridge family stayed
at Louisville, they received much attention. It was the
custom of the citizens, when any persons of note arrived
there, to get up a ball in their honor. They would
choose managers; circulate a subscription paper to meet
the expenses of the dance. Every signer, except
strangers, must provide his partner, see her safe there
and home again.</p>

<p>We had scarcely got located before a subscription
paper was presented to Uncle Forman and myself. But
the first ball after our arrival proved a failure, owing to
the inclemency of the weather, so that no ladies could
attend. General Wilkinson happened in town, and
though he and Uncle Forman stayed but a little while,
the young blades were disposed for a frolic. Some time
before this a ball was tendered to General St. Clair, when
the youngsters had a row, and destroyed the most of the
breakable articles that the house afforded. But such
instances of rudeness occurred only when no ladies were
present.</p>

<p>Not long after the failure on account of the weather,
the scheme for a dance was renewed, and, at length, we
had an elegant collection of southern fair. The ball was
opened by a minuet by Uncle Forman and a southern
lady&mdash;Aunt Forman did not dance. This was the last
time, I believe, that I saw that elegant dance performed.
Then two managers went around with numbers on paper
in a hat&mdash;one going to the ladies, the other to the gentlemen.
When the manager calls for lady No. 1, the lady
drawing that number stands up, and is led upon the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>36]</a></span>
floor, awaiting for gentleman No. 1, who, when called,
takes his place, and is introduced by the manager to the
lady. So they proceed with the drawing of couples until
the floor is full for the dance.</p>

<p>I, in my turn, was drawn, and introduced to my dancing
partner from Maryland, and we were called to the first
dance. This lady happened to be acquainted with Uncle
Forman&rsquo;s oldest son, General Thomas Marsh Forman,
which circumstance rendered our casual meeting all the
more agreeable. The officers of the garrison over the
river generally attended, and they brought the military
music along. I became well acquainted with the officers.
Dr. Carmichael,<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> of the army, used often to come over
and sit in my store.</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_14_14" id="Footnote_14_14"></a><a href="#FNanchor_14_14"><span class="label">[14]</span></a>
Dr. John F. Carmichael, from New Jersey, entered the army
in September, 1789, and, with the exception of a few months,
retained his position till his resignation in June, 1804. <a href="#FNanchor_14_14">Back</a></p>
</div>

<p>It was the last of February, I believe, when Uncle
Forman and his little fleet took their departure from
Louisville, destined for the Natchez country. The river
was now free from ice. There subsequently came a report,
that when they reached what was called the low
country, below the Cumberland and Tennessee rivers,
they were captured by the Indians. I was in a painful
suspense for a long time, and until I heard from them.</p>

<p>While Uncle Forman and party were sojourning in
Louisville, there was, it appears, a white man there, who
learned the names of Ezekiel Forman and Captain Osmun,
their place of destination, and all about them.
This fellow was a decoyer, who lived among the Indians,
and whose business it was to lure boats ashore for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>37]</a></span>
purposes of murder and robbery. At some point below the
mouth of the Tennessee, this renegade saw the boats approaching,
ran on the beach, imploring, upon his bended
knees, that Mr. Forman, calling him by name, would
come ashore and take him on board, as he had just escaped
from the Indians. Mr. Forman began to steer for
his relief, when Captain Osmun, who was a little way in
the rear, hailed Uncle, warning him to keep in the middle
of the stream, as he saw Indians in hiding behind trees
along the bank where the wily decoyer was playing his
treacherous part. Giving heed to this admonition, Uncle
Forman kept clear of the dangerous shore.</p>

<p>Then an old Indian, finding that his plot was exposed,
ran down to the beach, hailing the boats: &ldquo;Where you
go?&rdquo; It is not clear what could have been the Indian&rsquo;s
motive in making a display of himself, and seeking the
information already known to his renegade associate.
But for the circumstance of Captain Osmun being in the
rear, and discovering the exposed Indians screened behind
trees, the whole party might have been lured on
shore and massacred. It seems that, after boats entered
the Mississippi, they were not molested by the Indians,
as they were not at war with the Spaniards.</p>

<p>I was left in Louisville, with a store of goods. When
I had disposed of them, I was directed to join Uncle
Forman at Natchez; but some considerable time was
necessary to trade off my stock, and convert it into tobacco.
I spent my time very pleasantly at Louisville.
The southern people are remarkably friendly to strangers.
One family, in particular, Mr. and Mrs. Ashby, were as
kind to me as though I had been their own son. They
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>38]</a></span>
soon called on Uncle and Aunt Forman, showing all possible
attention, and soon became quite familiar.</p>

<p>One day, Mr. Ashby called, and inquired of Aunt for
&ldquo;<em>old</em> Mr. Forman.&rdquo; &ldquo;I tell you, Mr. Ashby,&rdquo; Mrs.
Forman laughingly replied, &ldquo;you shall not call my husband
<em>old</em>. Please to refer to him as Mr. Forman, and
our nephew as Mr. Sam. Forman.&rdquo; Mr. Ashby took the
suggestion in good part, and promised ready obedience.
After Uncle and Aunt Forman left for the Natchez
country, Mrs. Ashby would come to my store like a
mother, and inquire into the condition of my lodgings,
and sent bed and bedding, and had a kind old woman examine
my trunk, taking out all my clothing, first airing
and then nicely replacing them, and kindly did all my
washing during my stay. Mr. Ashby had a farm a little
way out of town, but he and his family came in very
often. Mrs. Ashby never came without making me a
motherly call, and looking over my clothing to see if any
repairs were needed. I never parted with briefly-made
acquaintances with so much regret.</p>

<p>I became very intimate with a Mr. Smith, from New
York, a young gentleman about my own age. The Virginians,
as were most of the Louisville people, were very
fond of dancing. Smith and I agreed to let each other
know when a hop was in agitation, and they were very
frequent. When notified by him of one such occasion, I
apologized for not being able to go, as I had no suitable
pumps. &ldquo;You have purchased,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;a parcel of
elegant moccasins for your New York ladies. You don a
pair, and I will another.&rdquo; &ldquo;Good! good!&rdquo; we mutually
ejaculated. So we engaged our favorite partners, and
attended the ball. It was something new to appear in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>39]</a></span>
such an assembly decked off in such Indian gear; but
they were much admired, and, at the next dance, almost
all appeared in moccasins. So, it seems, we led the ton,
and introduced a new fashion.</p>

<p>There was but one tavern and one boarding-house in
the place. The boarding-house was kept by a Dr. Walter,
who was also the pilot to take boats over the Falls; and
he was, moreover, a great hunter and fisherman. One
day in April, I think, at some public festival, several of
our boarders, the leader was the Commissary of the
Army, proposed to have what they called <em>a setting</em>, and
asked me to join them. I had often heard the commissary
relate his exploits&mdash;drinking egg-nog was then all
the go. I declined to share in the frolic, fearing the influence
of these southern blades on such occasions. In
the course of the night, I was alarmed by the rattling
of stones thrown against my store-door and window-shutters.
At first, I thought it might be Indians. The
clatter was kept up, and the glass windows all broken.
I finally concluded that it was the work of the egg-nog
party. Not only were my windows completely shattered,
but my store door was broken open by the pelting of
large stones.</p>

<p>These egg-nog disturbers served Captain Thomas, the
landlord, in the same way as they had done me. The
next morning, when we all met at the breakfast table
at our boarding-house, scarcely a word was spoken during
the meal. As I went out of the door, passing my
friend, the commissary, I asked him if he would direct
my windows glazed, and some little carpenter work done.
He pretended to be astonished how they should have
been broken. I made no reply, but walked back to my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>40]</a></span>
store, only looked at him and smiled. In the afternoon,
at Captain Thomas&rsquo;s, the business assumed almost a
tragical form&mdash;dirks were nearly drawn; however, it was
amicably settled.</p>

<p>The next morning these gentlemen asked me if I
would be satisfied if my windows and door were made
whole. I answered in the affirmative, and asked them
whether they had not acted very imprudently, situated
as we were on the frontiers in time of Indian warfare.
&ldquo;You know,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;that it was but a little time since
that Captain Thomas and some others saw Indians in the
night making, as they supposed, for my store, when I
kept it up by Bear Grass creek; and a few people got
together in the night, and followed the Indian trail out
of the village without alarming me. The Indians evidently
thought themselves discovered, and retired,
hence I escaped. In consequence of this alarm, I immediately
moved from that place to the center of the
village, into the corner building opposite the tavern.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was observed one Sunday morning, soon after starting
my store, that it was not opened on that day, as other
establishments were; and I was asked why I kept my
store closed&mdash;that Sunday had not crossed the mountains,
and that I was the first person who kept his store
shut on that day. I told them that I brought the Sabbath
with me. It so happened that I had the honor of
being the first to observe the day in Louisville.</p>

<p>Directly opposite to me a billiard table was kept. It
was customary at the south for ladies to indulge in billiards,
considering it a genteel and healthful amusement.
During the morning hours, a few ladies used to honor
me with a call, when I would spend a little while in that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>41]</a></span>
pleasant recreation; but I never gambled, and ladies&rsquo;
company is always more agreeable than gentlemen&rsquo;s.
Besides, if you play with gentlemen, it is apt to lead to
gambling; and it was consequently better to pay for the
use of the table with ladies, when one improves in manners
from their refinement.</p>

<p>One day Captain Thomas brought a little negro boy
to my store, tendering me his services while I remained
in Louisville; that he should be of no expense to
me, but live at home, and come over regularly and do
my chores, tote water, sweep my store, clean my shoes,
etc. The captain explained that he had another boy of
about the same age and size, and that one was better
than both. I had a spruce colored barber, who was also
a tailor, the pleasure of whose company I occasionally
had in helping out in my labors.</p>

<p>Sometime about the latter part of May, perhaps, four
tobacco boats arrived at Louisville on their way to New
Orleans, under the respective command of Captain Andrew
Bayard, Captain Winters, and Captain Gano, of
New York, and Captain January, of Kentucky. Captain
Bayard&rsquo;s boat received some injury in passing over the
Falls of the Ohio, and he had to unload to repair damages.
I had been some time negotiating with a rich
planter, Mr. Buckner, of Louisville. After I had heard
of the accident to Captain Bayard&rsquo;s boat, Mr. Buckner
came into the village. I got him in my store, locked
the door, and told him that now was the time to close
our long-talked-of trade, so that I could have the company
of this descending fleet. After spending the night
in conversation, I gave up my bed to Mr. Buckner, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>42]</a></span>
threw down some blankets and coarse clothes for my own
lodging.</p>

<p>To make a long story short, we effected a trade&mdash;closing
out my store of goods to him. He bought me a
tobacco boat, loaded her with this product of the country,
and got matters and things arranged so that I was
ready to accompany the descending fleet. Of these
tobacco traders, I was partially acquainted with Mr.
Bayard. I had at Louisville a competitor in trade, a
young Irish gentleman, but he could not succeed.</p>

<p>My boat was loaded below the Falls, and by some
means the hands suffered her to break from her fastenings,
and went a mile or two down stream before they
brought her to. I put my blanket on board of Mr. Bayard&rsquo;s
boat, and got on board with him, and took my tea
with him. In the evening, being moonlight, my canoe,
with an old sailor, came for me. I took some blankets
and wrapped them around my arms carelessly. I jumped
into the canoe; and the sailor, it seems, had taken a
little too much whisky, so that when he pushed off from
Mr. Bayard&rsquo;s boat, in order to clear its bow, he leaned
over so far as to make the canoe dip water; and, in recovering
his position, he leaned so far the other way that
the canoe filled. My arms being entangled with the
blankets, I was totally helpless. Mr. Bayard&rsquo;s hands
jumped into their small boat, came to my rescue, and
saved me from a watery grave.</p>

<p>Partly from economy, and partly from lack of time to
secure another hand, I attempted to manage my tobacco
boat, which was somewhat smaller than the usual size,
with less than the usual supply of boatmen. This made
it come hard on me, whose unskilled strength was but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>43]</a></span>
half that of an ordinary man. I had this old sailor with
me for one watch, and an old North-western man and a
Jerseyman for another. The boats would follow the current,
except when passing islands, when the men must
all beat their oars. I believe the old sailor, while on
board, was a little deranged. After I discharged him at
Natchez, he was found, I was told, in the woods, dead.</p>

<p>Nothing of any moment occurred while descending the
Ohio, until we reached Fort Massac, an old French fortification,
about thirty miles above the mouth of the Ohio.
It was a beautiful spot. All of the captains, and some
of the hands, with a small boat, went on shore, while our
tobacco boats glided gently along. When we landed, we
separated in squads, and visited the old deserted ramparts,
which appeared quite fresh. It was in the afternoon,
just after a refreshing shower. Those first arriving
at the intrenchment, espied a fresh moccasin track. We
all looked at it, and then at each other, and, without
uttering a word, all faced about, and ran as fast as possible
for the little boat. Some hit its locality, while
others struck the river too high up, and others, too low.</p>

<p>Those of us who missed our way concluded, in our
fright, that the Indians had cut us off; and no one had
thought to take his rifle but me, and I feared that I
should be the first to fall. After we were all safe on one
of the tobacco boats, we recovered our speech, and each
one told how he felt, and what he thought, during our
flight to the boats. This locality of Fort Massac, we
understood, was the direct way from the Ohio, in that
country, to St. Louis, and probably the track we saw was
that of some lonely Indian; and, judging from its freshness,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>44]</a></span>
the one who made it was as much frightened from
our numbers as we were at our unexpected discovery.</p>

<p>I will note a little circumstance that occurred during
our passage down the Ohio. One day, I was ahead of
the fleet, when one of the boats passed by suddenly,
when we observed by the woods that we were standing
still&mdash;evidently aground, or fast on something below the
surface. I gave notice to the boats behind to come on,
and take position between my boat and shore, hoping, by
this means, to raise a temporary swell in the river, and,
by fastening a rope to my boat, and extending along beside
the others, and making the other end fast to a tree
on shore, be enabled to get loose.</p>

<p>While thus engaged, we heard a whistle, like that of a
quail. Some observed that quail never kept in the
woods, and we felt some fear that it might be Indians;
but we continued our efforts at the rope, and the boat
was soon so far moved that we discovered that we were
fast upon a planter&mdash;that is, the body of a tree firmly
embedded in the river bottom. At last, the men could
partly stand upon it, and, with a hand-saw, so weakened
it that it broke off, and we were released.</p>

<p>Another dangerous obstruction is a tree becoming undermined
and falling into the river, and the roots fastening
themselves in the muddy bottom, while, by the constant
action of the current, the limbs wear off, and the body
keeps sawing up and down with great force, rising frequently
several feet above the water, and then sinking as
much below. These are called &ldquo;sawyers,&rdquo; and often
cause accidents to unsuspecting navigators.</p>

<p>When we arrived at the mouth of the Ohio, we stopped.
I fastened my boat to trees, and the other boats did
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>45]</a></span>
likewise. We kept watch, with an ax in hand, to cut the
fastenings in case of a surprise by Indians. Here were
marks of buffalo having rested. Where the waters of
the Mississippi and Ohio mingle, they look like putting
dirty soap-suds and pure water together. So we filled
all our vessels that were water-tight, for fear we might
suffer for want of good water on our voyage. But we
found out, afterward, that the Mississippi was very good
water, when filtered.</p>

<p>After we got all arranged, the second day after we
embarked, the captains agreed that we would, in rotation,
dine together, which rendered our journey more pleasant.
Mr. Bayard&rsquo;s and my boat were frequently fastened together
while descending the Ohio, but on the Mississippi,
from the turbulence of the stream, it was not possible to
do so. The first day that we entered the Mississippi, we
discharged all our rifles and pistols, as we were then out of
danger from the hostile Indians. In the afternoon, we
had a strong wind ahead, which made a heavy sea, accompanied
with thunder and lightning. The waves ran so
high that we felt in danger of foundering. The forward
boat pulled hard for shore, which we all followed.</p>

<p>Presently, we saw an Indian canoe pulling for that
boat. I asked my North-western man what that meant.
He looked wild, but did not know what to make of it. I
directed the men to pull away, and I would keep an eye
upon the suspicious visitors, and at the same time load
our rifles and pistols again. Reaching the advanced
boat, the Indians were kindly received, and no fighting;
and, instead of hostile demonstrations, they lent a hand
in rowing.</p>

<p>After much hard work, we at length all effected a landing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>46]</a></span>
in safety. We then prepared for dinner. It so happened
that it was my turn to receive the captains at dinner.
Having a large piece of fresh beef&mdash;enough and to spare,
I invited three of our copper-faces to dine with us.
Dinner over, Captain Gano set the example of <em>pitching
the fork</em> into the beef, as we used, in our school days, to
pitch the fork into the ground. So the Indians, one
after the other, imitated the captain, and very dextrously
pitched their forks also into the beef, thinking, probably,
that it was a white man&rsquo;s ceremony that should be observed.</p>

<p>After dinner, at the conclusion of the pitching incident,
I mixed some whisky and water in the only glass I
had, and handed it to one of the captains; and then repeating
it, filling the tumbler equally alike in quantity,
handed it in succession to the others. When I came to
the Indians, not knowing their relative rank, I happened
to present the glass to the lowest in order, as I discovered
by his declining it; but when I came to the leader,
he took the offering, and reaching out his hand to me in
a genteel and graceful manner, shook mine heartily; and
then repeated the cordial shake with each of the others,
not omitting his own people, and then drank our healths
as politely, I imagine, as Lord Chesterfield could have
done. The other Indians were similarly treated, and, in
turn, as gracefully acknowledged the compliment. They
all appeared much pleased with their reception.</p>

<p>This ceremony over, our men asked leave to visit the
opposite side of the river, where these Indians had a
large encampment. This granted, they all went to get
their rifles. The Indians seemed to understand etiquette
and politeness, and objected to the men going
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>47]</a></span>
armed. But, instead of speaking to the men, they addressed
the captains of the boats, saying: &ldquo;We have
no objections to your men going among our people, if
they don&rsquo;t take their rifles. We came among you as
friends, bringing no arms along.&rdquo; We, of course, told
our men to leave their rifles behind. They did so.
Returning, they reported that there were a good many
Indians there. By some means, some of our men must
have let the Indians have <i>la tafia</i>&mdash;a cheap variety of
rum distilled from molasses. At all events, they became
very much intoxicated, &ldquo;and we,&rdquo; said the visitors,
&ldquo;were very apprehensive of difficulty; but a squaw told
us that the Indians could not fight, as she had secreted
all their knives, and we were very much relieved when
morning appeared, so we could bid good-by to our new
acquaintances.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The next day we arrived at <i>L&rsquo;Anse a la Graisse</i>,
which place, or adjoining it, bears the name of New
Madrid, which is the American part of the little village
settled under the auspices of Colonel George Morgan.
Uncle Forman wrote me by all means to call at
this Spanish post, as he had left my name with the genteel
commandant there, who would expect to see me.
In the morning, after breakfast, we all prepared our
toilets preparatory to paying our respects to the officer
of the place. The captains did me the honor of making
me the foreman of the party, as my name would be familiar
to the commandant. I regret that I have forgotten
his name.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> We made our call at as early an hour
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>48]</a></span>
as we could, so that we might pursue our voyage without
any unnecessary waste of time.</p>

<div class="footnote">

In July, 1789, less than a year before, Lieutenant Pierre
Foucher, with four officers and thirty soldiers, had been sent
from New Orleans to establish a post at this place, as stated in
<i>Gayarre&rsquo;s Louisiana</i>, 1854, p. 268. It is generally asserted that this
settlement was commenced as early as 1780; but the Spanish
census of Louisiana, both in 1785 and 1788, make no mention of
the place. <a href="#FNanchor_15_15">Back</a></p>
</div>

<p>Arrived at the gate, the guard was so anxious to trade
his tame raccoon with our men that he scarcely took any
notice of us. We went to head-quarters; there was but
little ceremony. When we were shown into the commander&rsquo;s
presence, I stepped toward him a little in advance
of my friends, and announced my name. I was
most cordially and familiarly received. Then I introduced
my friends, mentioning their respective places of
residence. After a little conversation, we rose to retire,
when the commandant advanced near me, and politely
asked me to dine with him an hour after twelve o&rsquo;clock,
and bring my accompanying friends with me. I turned
to the gentlemen for their concurrence, which they gave,
when we all returned to our boats.</p>

<p>I then observed to my friends that the commandant
would expect some present from us&mdash;such was the custom&mdash;and
what should it be? Mr. Bayard, I believe,
asked me to suggest some thing in our power to tender.
I then remarked, that, as we had a plenty of good hams,
that we fill a barrel, and send them to our host; that
they might prove as acceptable as any thing. The proposition
met the approval of all, and the hams were accordingly
sent at once, with perhaps an accompanying
note.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>49]</a></span>
At one hour after twelve o&rsquo;clock, I well remember, we
found ourselves comfortably seated at the hospitable
board of the Spanish commandant, who expressed much
delight at receiving our fine present. He gave us an
elegant dinner in the Spanish style, and plenty of good
wine and liquors, and coffee without cream. The commandant,
addressing me, while we were indulging in the
liquids before us, said that we must drink to the health
of the ladies in our sweet liquors. &ldquo;So,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;we
will drink the health of the Misses Forman&rdquo;&mdash;my worthy
cousins, who had preceded us in a visit to this garrison.</p>

<p>After dinner, the commandant invited us to take a
walk in the fine prairies. He said he could drive a
coach-and-four through these open woods to St. Louis.
There came up a thunder-storm and sharp lightning, and
he asked me what I called that in English, and I told
him, when he pleasantly observed: &ldquo;You learn me to
talk English, and I will learn you French.&rdquo; Returning
to head-quarters, we took tea, and then got up to take
our final leave. &ldquo;O, no!&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t spare you,
gentlemen. I&rsquo;m all alone. Please to come to-morrow,
one hour after twelve, and dine again with me.&rdquo; So, at
the appointed time, we were on hand again. The same
kind hospitality was accorded us as on the preceding
day.</p>

<p>In the evening, we thought we should surely tender
the last farewell. But no; we must come again, for the
third day, to enjoy his good company and delightful
viands. That evening, there was a Spanish dance, all
common people making up the company&mdash;French, Canadians,
Spaniards, Americans. The belle of the room
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>50]</a></span>
was Cherokee Katy, a beautiful little squaw, dressed in
Spanish style, with a turban on her head, and decked off
very handsomely. On these occasions, a king and queen
were chosen to be sovereigns for the next meeting. The
commandant was asked to honor them by taking a partner,
and sharing in the mazy dance, which, of course, he
declined; and we also had an invitation, but declined
also. The commandant said he always went to these
happy gatherings, and sat a little while, and once, he
added, he played a little while on his own violin, for his
own and their amusement.</p>

<p>He expressed much regret at parting with us. He
said he was so lonesome. He was a man not over thirty,
I suppose, highly accomplished, and spoke pretty good
English. I fear he was, in after years, swallowed up in
the earthquake,<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> which destroyed many; among them, I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>51]</a></span>
believe, a Mr. Morris, who was a brother to Mrs. Hurd;
a Mr. Lintot, from Natchez, who was a passenger with
me from New Orleans to Philadelphia.</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_16_16" id="Footnote_16_16"></a><a href="#FNanchor_16_16"><span class="label">[16]</span></a>
We learn, from Gayarre&rsquo;s <i>History of the Spanish Domination of
Louisiana</i>, that, in July, 1789, Pierre Foucher, a lieutenant of the
regiment of Louisiana, was sent, with two sergeants, two corporals,
and thirty soldiers, to build a fort at New Madrid, and
take the civil and military command of that district, with instructions
to govern those new colonists in such a way as to
make them feel that they had found among the Spaniards the
state of ease and comfort of which they were in quest.</p>

<p>Colonel John Pope, in his <i>Tour Through the Western and Southern
States</i>, states, under date, March 12, 1791: &ldquo;Breakfasted and
dined with Signor Pedro Foucher, commandant at New Madrid.
The garrison consists of about ninety men, who are well supplied
with food and raiment. They have an excellent train of artillery,
which appears to be their chief defense. Two regular companies
of musqueteers, with charged bayonets, might take this
place. Of this opinion is the commandant himself, who complains
that he is not sufficiently supported. He is a Creole of
French extraction, of Patagonian size, polite in his manners, and
of a most noble presence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lieutenant Foucher must have left the country long before
the great earthquake of 1811-12. The Spaniards evacuated
their posts on the Mississippi to the north of 31st degree in 1798;
and, two years later, transferred the country to France, and, in
1803, it was purchased by the United States. <a href="#FNanchor_16_16">Back</a></p>
</div>

<p>On our entering the Mississippi, we had agreed that
the foremost boat should fire a gun as a token for landing,
if they saw a favorable spot after the middle of the
afternoon. It was not possible to run in safety during
the night. It so happened that every afternoon we had
a thunder shower and head wind.</p>

<p>Nothing special occurred, I believe, till our arrival at
Natchez. There was no settlement from <i>L&rsquo;Anse a la
Graisse</i> to <i>Bayou Pierre</i>, something like sixty miles
above Natchez. At Bayou Pierre lived Colonel Bruin,<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>52]</a></span>
of the Virginia Continental line, who, after the war, took
letters from General Washington to the governor of that
country while it belonged to Spain, and secured a fine
land grant. I once visited Colonel Bruin, with a gentleman
from Natchez. That section of country is remarkably
handsome, and the soil rich. The colonel&rsquo;s dwelling-house
was on the top of a large mound, and his
barn on another, near by. These mounds are common in
the Ohio and Mississippi countries, and no tradition gives
their origin.</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_17_17" id="Footnote_17_17"></a><a href="#FNanchor_17_17"><span class="label">[17]</span></a>
Colonel Peter Bryan Bruin, son of an Irish gentleman, who
had become implicated in the Irish Rebellion of 1756, and confiscation
and exile were his penalty. He brought with him to America
his only son, who was reared a merchant. In the War of the
Revolution, he entered Morgan&rsquo;s famous riflemen as a lieutenant,
shared in the assault on Quebec, where he was made a prisoner,
and confined in a prison ship, infected with small-pox, for six
months. He was finally exchanged, and at length promoted to
the rank of major, serving to the end of the war. Soon after
settling near the mouth of Bayou Pierre, he was appointed alcalde,
or magistrate, under the Spanish Government; and when
the Mississippi Territory was organized, in 1798, he was appointed
one of the three territorial judges, remaining in office until he
resigned, in 1810. He lived till a good old age, was a devoted
patriot, and a man of high moral character. <a href="#FNanchor_17_17">Back</a></p>
</div>

<p>While in Louisville, I bought a young cub bear, and
kept him chained in the back room of my store. He
was about a month or two old when I got him; and when
I went down the river, I took him along to Natchez.
When twelve or fifteen months old, he became very
saucy; I only could keep him in subjection. When he
became too troublesome, Uncle Forman had him killed,
and invited several gentlemen to join him in partaking
of his bear dinner.</p>

<p>When our little fleet of five boats first came in sight
of the village of Natchez, it presented quite a formidable
appearance, and caused a little alarm at the fort; the
drum beat to arms, but the affright soon subsided.
About this time, a report circulated that general somebody,
I have forgotten his name, was in Kentucky raising
troops destined against that country; but it all
evaporated.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_18_18" id="Footnote_18_18"></a><a href="#FNanchor_18_18"><span class="label">[18]</span></a>
This refers to the proposed settlement at the Walnut Hills,
at the mouth of the Yazoo, under the auspices of the famous
Yazoo Company, composed mostly of prominent South Carolina
and Georgia gentlemen. Dr. John O&rsquo;Fallon, who subsequently
married a sister of General George Rogers Clark, located at
Louisville, Ky., as the agent and active partner in that region
and endeavored to enlist General Clark as the military leader of
the enterprise; but it would appear that the general declined
the command, and Colonel John Holder, a noted Kentucky pioneer
and Indian fighter, was chosen in his place. But nothing
was accomplished. The original grant was obtained by bribery,
fraud, and corruption, from the Georgia Legislature; and a subsequent
legislature repudiated the transaction, and ordered all
the documents and records connected with it to be burned in
the public square. <a href="#FNanchor_18_18">Back</a></p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>53]</a></span>
Natchez was then a small place, with houses generally
of a mean structure, built mostly on the low bank of the
river, and on the hillside. The fort was on a handsome,
commanding spot, on the elevated ground, from which
was a most extensive view up the river, and over the
surrounding country. The governor&rsquo;s house was not far
from the garrison. Uncle Forman had at first hired a
large house, about half-way up the hill from the landing,
where he lived until he bought a plantation of five hundred
acres on the bank of St. Catherine&rsquo;s creek, about
four miles from Natchez. This he regarded as only a
temporary abode, until he could become better acquainted
with the country. The place had a small clearing and a
log house on it, and he put up another log house to correspond
with it, about fourteen feet apart, connecting
them with boards, with a piazza in front of the whole.
The usual term applied to such a structure was that it
was &ldquo;two pens and a passage.&rdquo; This connecting passage
made a fine hall, and altogether gave it a good and comfortable
appearance.</p>

<p>Boards were scarce, and I do not remember of seeing
any saw or grist-mills in the country. Uncle Forman
had a horse-mill, something like a cider-mill, to grind
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>54]</a></span>
corn for family use. In range with his dwelling he built
a number of negro houses, some distance off, on the
bank of St. Catherine&rsquo;s creek. It made quite a pretty
street. The little creek was extremely convenient. The
negroes the first year cleared a large field for tobacco,
for the cultivation of that article was the object of Mr.
Forman&rsquo;s migration to that country.</p>

<p>After my arrival, and while sojourning at Natchez,
Uncle Forman asked me if I intended to apply to the
government for lands. I replied that I did not want
any. He said he was glad of it, unless I remained in
the country. He hinted something to the effect that
one of the Spanish officers, who talked of leaving the
country, had an elegant plantation, with negroes for its
cultivation, and he thought of buying it, if I would
stay and take it; that if I took land of government, and
sold out, it might give umbrage to the governor, and
I, being a relation, he suffer by it. I told him my
father was loath to let me come away, and I promised
that I would return if my life was spared me.</p>

<p>After this, Surveyor-General Dunbar,<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> much to my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>55]</a></span>
surprise, called on me, and said that he brought the
survey and map of my land, and presented a bill of
sixty dollars for his services. I told him that I had not
asked for land, nor had Governor Gayoso ever said any
thing to me about land, nor did I want any. General
Dunbar replied that the governor directed him to survey
for Don Samuel S. Forman eight hundred acres of land,
and that it was the best and most valuable tract that he
knew of in the district, including a beautiful stream of
water, with a gravelly bottom&mdash;rare in that country; that
it was well located, near a Mr. Ellis, at the White Cliffs,
and advised me by all means to take it. Uncle Forman
happened to be absent, and I was in doubt what to do.
At last I paid the bill and took the papers. The largest
quantity that the Spanish Government gave to a young
man who settled in that country was two hundred and
forty acres, so the governor showed much friendship
by complimenting me with so large a grant.</p>

Sir William Dunbar, son of Sir Archibald Dunbar, was born
at Elgin, Scotland, and received a superior education in Glasgow
and London. On account of failing health, he obtained a stock
of goods for the Indian trade; and, landing in Philadelphia in
April, 1771, took his goods to Fort Pitt, and about 1773 he went
to West Florida to form a plantation. He suffered much during
the period of the Revolution, and in 1772 settled near Natchez,
became chief surveyor under the Spanish Government, and in
1798 he was appointed astronomical commissioner on the part of
Spain in establishing the boundary. He was shortly after appointed
by Governor Sargeant, on the organization of Mississippi
Territory, under the United States Government, chief judge of
the Court of Quarter Sessions. He corresponded with the most
distinguished scientific men of his time, and contributed to the
Transactions of the American Philosophical Society. He died in
1810, leaving many descendants. <a href="#FNanchor_19_19">Back</a></p>
</div>

<p>I must go back a little, and state that my good traveling
companions, Messrs. Bayard, Gano, Winters, and
January, parted from me, and continued their journey
down the river. Uncle Forman had been acquainted
with Mr. Bayard, in Philadelphia, and their meeting in
a distant and foreign country was very gratifying. The
interview was very brief, for Mr. Bayard and associates
were anxious to pursue their voyage.</p>

<p>At Natchez we made many agreeable acquaintances.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>56]</a></span>
Governor Gayoso, a bachelor, was very affable and pleasant,
and had an English education. The fort-major,
Stephen Minor,<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> was a Jerseyman from Princeton, and
Mr. Hutchins,<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> a wealthy planter, was a brother to
Thomas Hutchins, the geographer-general of the United
States. His wife was a Conover, from near Freehold
village, and knew more about Freehold than I did.
Also a Mr. Moore, a wealthy planter, Mr. Bernard Lintot,
who moved from Vermont before the war, and Mr.
Ellis, a wealthy planter&mdash;all having large families, sons
and daughters, very genteel and accomplished. These
all lived from eight to fourteen miles from us.</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_20_20" id="Footnote_20_20"></a><a href="#FNanchor_20_20"><span class="label">[20]</span></a>
Stephen Minor was a native of Pennsylvania, well-educated,
and early made his way West; first to St. Louis, and then to
New Orleans, and was soon appointed to official station by the
Spanish Government, rising eventually to the governorship at
Natchez, and so continuing till the evacuation of the country. He
then became a citizen of the United States, and was useful to
the country. He died in after years at Concord, Mississippi. <a href="#FNanchor_20_20">Back</a></p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_21_21" id="Footnote_21_21"></a><a href="#FNanchor_21_21"><span class="label">[21]</span></a> Colonel Anthony Hutchins was a native of New Jersey;
early migrated to North Carolina, and in 1772 explored the
Natchez country, settling permanently at the White Apple village,
twelve miles from Natchez, the following year, and survived
the troubles of the Revolution, and died when past eighty years
of age. <a href="#FNanchor_21_21">Back</a></p>
</div>

<p>In the village of Natchez resided Monsieur and
Madam Mansanteo&mdash;Spanish Jews, I think&mdash;who were
the most kind and hospitable of people. These families, in
town and country, formed our principal associates. Governor
Gayoso told us, after we moved out to St. Catherine,
that there would always be a plate for us at his table.</p>

<p>The year 1790 was a very sickly one for unacclimated
persons in the Natchez country. All our family adults
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>57]</a></span>
had more or less fever, and fever and ague. Uncle Forman
was severely afflicted with gout&mdash;a lump almost as
big as a small hen&rsquo;s egg swelled out at one of his elbows,
with something of the appearance of chalk. Poor Betsey
Church was taken with a fever, and died in a few days;
a great loss to the family, having been a valuable and
much respected member of it for many years. I was
the only adult of the family who was not confined to the
house with sickness.</p>

<p>Stephen Minor, the fort-major, married the eldest
daughter of the planter, Mr. Ellis. Our family was
much visited by the Spanish officers, who were very genteel
men; and Major Minor was very intimate, and
seemed to take much interest in us.</p>

<p>When the time was fixed for my departure, by the way
of New Orleans, and thence by sea to Philadelphia, Uncle
Forman said: &ldquo;Well, you must direct Moses, the coachman,
to get up the carriage, take two of your cousins
with you, and take leave of all your good friends.&rdquo; The
carriage, which had its top broken off crossing the mountains
in Pennsylvania, had been fitted up in Natchez,
with neat bannister work around the top of the body,
which rendered it more convenient for the country.
We sometimes took the family in it, and went out strawberrying
over the prairies.</p>

<p>Cousins Augusta and Margaret accompanied me on
my farewell tour. Ours was the first four-wheeled carriage
that ever passed over those grounds&mdash;I can&rsquo;t say
roads, for the highway was only what was called a bridle-path&mdash;all
traveling at that day was on horseback.
When we visited one place, some of our friends from
another locality meeting us there would ascertain the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>58]</a></span>
day we designed visiting their house, that they might
have the cane-brakes along the trail cleared away sufficient
to permit the comfortable passage of the carriage;
and we must, moreover, be on time, or some small gust
of wind might again obstruct the passage. Our visits
were all very pleasant save the unhappy part of the final
bidding each other farewell.</p>

<p>During this excursion, Governor Gayoso had given
permission for a Baptist clergyman to preach one Sunday,
which was the first time a protestant minister had
been allowed to hold religious services. The meeting
was held at Colonel Hutchins&rsquo;. We went from the residence
of some friends in that vicinity. After service
we were invited to stay and dine at Colonel Hutchins&rsquo;.
When we were ready to depart, all came out of the house
to see us off, and I asked the ladies in a jocose way to
join us in the ride, when they began to climb over the
wheels as though they might endanger the safety of the
carriage; but this frolicsome banter over, we took our
departure. We spent several days in performing this
friendly round of visits&mdash;by-gone days of happiness
never to return.</p>

<p>When I was about leaving the country, Governor
Gayoso asked me what I intended to do with my land.
I replied, that if I did not return in a year or two, that
his excellency could do what he pleased with it. Some
years after, when I lived in Cazenovia, I contemplated
going back, and went to my large chest, which had
traveled with me from Pittsburg to New Orleans, and
thence in all my tramps and changes, where I supposed
all my Spanish papers were safe in a little drawer; but,
to my surprise, they were missing, and I never could
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>59]</a></span>
tell what became of them, as I kept the chest locked,
and retained the key. So vanished my eight hundred
acres of valuable land in the promising Mississippi
country.</p>

<p>On the arrival of Colonel Wyckoff, with his brother-in-law,
Scudder, from Tennessee, preparations were made
for our departure. Uncle Forman went down to New
Orleans with us. It was in June, 1791, I believe, that
we left Natchez. The parting with my kindred was most
trying and affecting, having traveled and hazarded our
lives together for so many hundred miles, and never expecting
to meet again in this life. Many of the poor
colored people, too, came and took leave of me, with
tears streaming down their cheeks. Take them altogether,
they were the finest lot of servants I ever saw.
They were sensible that they were all well cared for&mdash;well
fed, well clothed, well housed, each family living separately,
and they were treated with kindness. Captain
Osmun,<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> their overseer, was a kind-hearted man, and used
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>60]</a></span>
them well. They had ocular proof of their happy situation
when compared with their neighbor&rsquo;s servants.
It was the custom of the country to exchange work at
times; and, one day, one of our men came to me, and
said: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think it is right to exchange work with
these planters; for I can, with ease, do more work than
any two of their men;&rdquo; and added, &ldquo;their men pound
their corn over night for their next day&rsquo;s supply, and
they are too weak to work.&rdquo; Poor fellows, corn was all
they had to eat.</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_22_22" id="Footnote_22_22"></a><a href="#FNanchor_22_22"><span class="label">[22]</span></a>
Benajah Osmun served, as Mr. Forman has previously stated,
at the defeat of General Washington&rsquo;s troops on Long Island, in
August, 1776, when he was made a prisoner; he was then, apparently,
a soldier in the ranks. On January 1, 1777, he was appointed
a second lieutenant and quartermaster in Colonel
Shreve&rsquo;s Second New Jersey regiment, which he subsequently
resigned. In September, 1778, he again entered the army as an
ensign in the second regiment; was a prisoner of war on April
25, 1780; made a lieutenant January 1, 1781, retiring at the close
of the war with the brevet rank of captain.</p>

<p>In 1802, he was made lieutenant-colonel of the Adams county
militia; and when Colonel Burr visited the country, in 1807, on
his mysterious mission, he was the guest of Colonel Osmun, who
was one of his two bondsmen for his appearance at court, for
they were fellow officers in the Revolution. Colonel Osmun
settled a plantation at the foot of Half Way hill, near Natchez,
became wealthy, and there died, a bachelor, at a good old age. <a href="#FNanchor_22_22">Back</a></p>
</div>

<p>Uncle Forman and I stopped the first night with Mr.
Ellis, at the White Cliffs, and next day embarked on
board of a boat for New Orleans. On our way down we
sometimes went on shore and took a bowl of chocolate for
breakfast with some rich planter, a very common custom
of the country. The night before our arrival at New Orleans
we put up with a Catholic priest; some gentlemen of
our company were well acquainted between Natchez and
New Orleans, and had learned the desirable stopping
places. The good priest received us kindly, gave us an
excellent supper, plenty of wine, and was himself very
lively. We took breakfast with him the next morning;
and before our departure the priest came up to me with
a silver plate in his hand, on which were two fine looking
pears, which he tendered me. He looked at first very
serious; but, remembering his good humor the previous
evening, I suspected his fun had not yet all run out. I
eyed him pretty close, and while thanking him, I rather
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>61]</a></span>
hesitated, when he urged me to take them. I knew no
pears grew in that country. I finally took one, weighed
it in my hand, and looked at him, till he bursted out into
a loud laugh. They were ingeniously wrought out of
stone or marble, and looked exactly like pears. I brought
them home and gave them to a friend.</p>

<p>Arriving in New Orleans, we took lodgings, and our
first business was to wait on his excellency Governor
Miro. Mr. Forman settling within his government with
so large a number of people, under an arrangement with
the Spanish ambassador at New York, Don Diego de
Gardoque, gave him a high standing. Uncle Forman
was in person a fine-looking man, very neat, prepossessing,
and of genteel deportment, so that he was always much
noticed.</p>

<p>As there was then no vessel in port destined for the
United States, I had to delay a couple of weeks for one.
At length the brig Navarre, Captain McFadden, made its
appearance, and soon loaded for Philadelphia. There
were a number of Americans in waiting, who engaged
their passage with me, on this vessel. Uncle Forman
did not leave the city until after the Navarre had taken
its departure. He suggested that I should take a formal
leave of Governor Miro and his secretary, Don Andre.
The secretary was a large, fine-looking man. I politely
asked him if he had any commands for the cape&mdash;Cape
Francois, a fine town in the northern part of St. Domingo,
usually dignified with the designation of the <i>The Cape</i>&mdash;for
which port, I believe, the vessel cleared. &ldquo;I know
not,&rdquo; said the secretary, &ldquo;to what cape you are going&mdash;only
take good care of yourself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After all were on board, the brig dropped down two or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>62]</a></span>
three miles, where the passengers went ashore, and laid
in provisions enough, the captain said, to have carried us
to London after our arrival in Philadelphia. I may
mention something about distances as computed in those
days. From Natchez to New Orleans was called three
hundred miles by water, and only one hundred and fifty
by land. From New Orleans to the Balize, at the mouth
of the Mississippi, was reckoned one hundred and five
miles. It was said that such was the immense volume
of the Mississippi river that it kept its course and muddy
appearance for a league out at sea.</p>

<p>There were no ladies among the passengers. We entered
into an arrangement that each passenger should, in
rotation, act as caterer for the party for each day. It
fell to my lot to lead off in this friendly service. We got
along very nicely, and with a good deal of mirthful
pleasure, for a couple of weeks, enjoying our viands and
wine as comfortably as if at a regular boarding house.
The captain&rsquo;s wife, however, was something of a drawback
to our enjoyment. She was a vinegary looking creature,
and as cross and saucy as her looks betokened,
was low-bred, ill-tempered, and succeeded in making herself
particularly disagreeable. During the pleasant weather
portion of our voyage, she managed, without cause,
to raise a quarrel with every passenger; and what added
to her naturally embittered feeling, was that we only
laughed at her folly.</p>

<p>When we arrived in sight of Cuba, the wind arose, and
blew almost a hurricane, causing a heavy sea. We were
in such danger of being cast away on the Florida reefs
that the captain summoned all hands on deck for counsel.
But, providentially, we escaped. For near two weeks
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>63]</a></span>
no cooking could be done, and each one was thankful to
take whatever he could obtain in one hand, and hold
fast to something with the other, such was the rolling
and pitching of our frail vessel. Most of the passengers
were sea-sick; I was among the few who escaped from
that sickening nausea. One night the rain was so heavy,
the lightning so vivid, and thunder so tremendous, that
the vessel trembled at every clap; when I went to my
friend Wyckoff, as well as others who were asleep, informing
them that it was a moment of no little danger and
excitement.</p>

<p>Captain McFadden was a most profane man. But
during the hours of our distress and danger he became very
mild and humble, but it lasted no longer than the storm.
The vinegary Mrs. McFadden, too, was very sensibly
affected during this trying period; for, standing in the
companion-way, leading to the cabin, she very humbly
and demurely said that she would go below and make her
peace. We all thought she could not be too quick
about it. She was a veritable Katharine, but he was not
a Petruchio.</p>

<p>Before we arrived at the capes of the Delaware, an
American sailor, who had made his escape from a British
man-of-war at the mouth of the Mississippi, sickened and
died on board our craft. When we got into the Delaware,
the sailors took his remains on shore and gave them a
decent sepulture. At length we reached Philadelphia in
safety.</p>

<p>General David Forman of New Jersey in 1789, entered
into a negotiation with the Spanish minister Don Diego
de Gardoque, for his brother Ezekiel Forman of Philadelphia,
to emigrate with his family, and about sixty colored people,
men, women and children, and settle in the Natchez country,
then under Spanish authority. Major Samuel S. Forman
accompanied this emigrating party, and in this narrative
gives a minute account of their trip, the places they passed
through and at which they stopped, prominent people they
met, with many curious particulars.</p>
